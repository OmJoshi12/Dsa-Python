The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive educational tool designed to demonstrate the working of searching, sorting, etc algorithms through step-by-step visualizations. It includes popular sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, as well as searching methods like Linear Search and Binary Search. The tool highlights key operations such as comparisons, swaps, and pivot selection using colors and animations, making complex processes easier to grasp. Users can compare algorithm efficiency, track performance metrics like time complexity and operation counts, and control the visualization speed to suit their pace. With its user-friendly interface, the visualizer serves as a valuable resource for learning, debugging, and improving algorithmic problem-solving skills.
